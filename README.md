# Adam's Motors

Welcome to Adam's Motors, a car rental application developed using Next.js, React.js, and TypeScript. This app allows users to explore various car models and easily rent vehicles.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: A React framework for production.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

## API Usage
The app utilizes the **Cars Ninja API** from RapidAPI to fetch car data. This API provides comprehensive details about different car models and specifications.

## Local Assets
Due to the unavailability of a specific Cars Images API, we have compiled a curated list of car models and corresponding image sources.
These images are locally hosted under the `public/cars` directory. This approach ensures quick load times and reliable access to assets.

## Open Source
The codebase for Adam's Motors is completely open source. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute the code as you see fit.
The development of this app has been greatly enhanced by various online tutorials & posts, reflecting the collaborative spirit of the web development community.
